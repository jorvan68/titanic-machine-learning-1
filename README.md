About Me

Hello, Jorvan here!

I am a technology enthusiast who is currently work as a Business Intelligence. With 3+ year experience in data, I have been providing end-to-end analysis from gathering information, cleaning and analyzing the data, developing dashboards and reports, and generating insights to provide business solutions. As a result of being specialized in data manipulation and data management, I get used to explore every data that i am working with, generate any possible insights in the form of story or summary that can be applied for decision making and business solutions for certain departments.

In order to enhance my experience aside from the learning process in college, I attempted to contribute and be active in several organizations, become an ambassador in numerous programs, and participate in business case competition. All of those with the intention of self development, accomplish non academic achievement, intensify leadership experience, and enlarge my working network.

On a personal level, I am good at analyzing, detail-oriented, self-initiative, and innovative. I have good communication skills and teamwork through a lot of experience in leading important discussions, engaging in various group projects, and delivering training as well.
